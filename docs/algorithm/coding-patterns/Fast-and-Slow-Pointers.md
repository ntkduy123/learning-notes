### Overview
Similar to the two pointers pattern, the fast and slow pointers pattern uses two pointers to traverse an iterable data structure at different speeds. It’s usually used to identify distinguishable features of directional data structures, such as a linked list or an array.

The pointers can be used to traverse the array or list in either direction, however, one moves faster than the other. Generally, the slow pointer moves forward by a factor of one, and the fast pointer moves by a factor of two in each step. However, the speed can be adjusted according to the problem statement.

Unlike the two pointers approach, which is concerned with data values, the fast and slow pointers approach is used to determine data structure traits using indices in arrays or node pointers in linked lists. The approach is commonly used to detect cycles in the given data structure, so it’s also known as Floyd’s cycle detection algorithm.

The key idea is that the pointers start at the same location, but they move forward at different speeds. If there is a cycle, the two are bound to meet at some point in the traversal. To understand the concept, think of two runners on a track. While they start from the same point, they have different running speeds. If the race track is a circle, the faster runner will overtake the slower one after completing a lap. On the other hand, if the track is straight, the faster runner will end the race before the slower one, hence never meeting on the track again. The fast and slow pointers pattern uses the same intuition.

### Does my problem match this pattern?


```java
class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World");
  }
}
```
